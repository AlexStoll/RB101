# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

# Define the two integers before the method definition, maybe get them from the user.
# Create the method which takes int1 and adds it to int2, making sure it's doing integer addition.

# START
# PRINT request for two integers
# SET int1 = GET first value
# SET int2 = GET second value
# Define method to
# PRINT return of int1 + int2
# END

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated

# Create an array of strings
# Define a method to return each value of the array and list them in one string

# START
# SET strings = an array of strings
# SET length = number of strings in the array
# SET counter = 0
# WHILE counter <= length
  # add each string to big_string
# PRINT big_string
# END


# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# Use the index of the array to add every other number to a new array
# So when the index is odd, add that value to the new array.

# START
# SET others = an empty array
# SET count = 0
# WHILE count <= size of the input array

#   IF index is odd
#     add the corresponding value to the empty array
#   ELSE
#     next
#   END
#   count += 1
#  END
